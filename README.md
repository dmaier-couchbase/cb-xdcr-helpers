# XDCR helper scripts in Python

## List all cluster references

The following example lists all set up XDCR remote clusters:

```python
import xdcrclient
xdcrclient.list_remotes("http://192.168.7.188:8091", "couchbase", "couchbase")
```
The return value is an array of cluster references.

```
['5b039e49fbdec518548250a7900377b1:local->192.168.7.188:8091']
```

The format of such an entry is:

* ${Reference UUID}:${Reference name}->${Host name}

## List all replication tasks

The following example lists you all XDCR replication tasks:

```python
import xdcrclient
xdcrclient.list("http://192.168.7.188:8091", "couchbase", "couchbase")
```

The return value is an array of the XDCR replication id-s.
```
['5b039e49fbdec518548250a7900377b1/travel-sample/travel-sample-xdcr']
```
Whereby the components of such an entry are:

* The UUID of the cluster reference
* The source bucket 
* The target bucket

## Get the UUID from the name of a cluster reference

The following example shows how to get the UUID of a cluster reference based on it's name

```python
import xdcrclient
xdcrclient.resolve_uuid("http://192.168.7.188:8091", "couchbase", "couchbase", "local")
```
The return value is:

```
'5b039e49fbdec518548250a7900377b1'
```

## Build a XDCR replication id from the name

The following example shows how to create the replication id from the source bucket name, the target bucket name and the remote cluster reference name:

```python
import xdcrclient
xdcrclient.link_id("http://192.168.7.188:8091", "couchbase", "couchbase", "b_source", "b_target", "local")
```
The return value is the XDCR replication id

```
'5b039e49fbdec518548250a7900377b1%2Fb_source%2Fb_target'
```

The components of the replication id are:

* The UUID of the cluster reference
* The source bucket
* The target bucket

The '/' is HTML encoded in order to use the id directly in further REST calls.
